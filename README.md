## Background

The NEC PSL010001 is a 364 Wh battery containing a 12S4P configuration of A123 ANR26650M1-B LiFePo4 cells. This battery is also sold under part number 078-000-110-00 for use within a standby power module (EMC 078-000-080) in EMC VMAX storage arrays.

In 2020, hundreds of used modules became available at a very low price point. However, although the battery module will accept a charge, discharging the battery requires communication with the module's BMS. Details on the communication scheme are not generally known.

## Goal

This repository aims to collect documentation about the module's BMS, with the overarching goal of learning how to communicate with it and enable discharge.
